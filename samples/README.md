# Tropo Ready Samples

These samples are a copy of [Tropo Javascript Samples](https://github.com/tropo/tropo-samples/tree/master/javascript)
enhanced with :
- declaration for local variables to make it debugging more convenient (ie, introspection of local variables),
- a few outbound samples (send-sms.js, bidirectional-sms.js, transfer-outbound.js)

This set of samples will be extended with scripts contributed to enhanced the emulator project.

## Quick start

Run `make run` to see samples executions via the Tropo emulator.

Tip: look at the launch arguments for Inbound/Outbound & Voice/SMS samples.
