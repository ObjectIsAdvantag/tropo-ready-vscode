# Tropo Ready for VS Code: the live coding experience for Tropo

Execute, Test or Debug your Tropo scripts from your local machine, thanks to a set of handy tools:
- have Tropo instantly run your local scripts thanks to the [Caddy+ngrok combo](tunnel/README.md)
- check your Tropo script are consistent before pushing them to Tropo Serverless environment (Javascript only),
- use Tropo launch configurations to debug your scripts within Visual Studio Code (Javascript only),

## Contribute

Our goal here is to enhance the experience for Tropo Scripting developers, 
by running, testing and debugging right from our laptop.

_For now, the Tropo emulator has been tested with a limited set of Tropo scripts.
Our goal is to extend it to mimic the Tropo Scripting runtime behavior.
By posting issues and scripts, you're contributing to the project, thanks!_

That being staid, there are good chances you encounter an issue when checking one of your script.
Please open an issue and post your script. 
/!\ Make sure to remove any sensitive data from your script before posting.

**If you have skills in Python, Ruby, PHP or Groovy, we'd love you to help us port the Tropo emulator to these platforms.**
Simply fork the Tropo emulator project, and start your own version for your favorite language.
Drop us a message if interested, we'll be happy to contribute!

And if you like the project, don't forget to twitt or write about it. Thanks.
